# ImgEncryption-Using-Lorenz-Attractor
  The aim of this project is to utilize the chaotic properties of lorenz attractor and its sensitivity to initial conditions to encrypt images.
## Papers that inspired the project:
- [A novel image encryption scheme using Lorenz attractor](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5138890)
- [A New Image Encryption Algorithm Based on Lorenz System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7861097)
