# ImgEncryption-Using-Lorenz-Attractor
This project implements an image encryption and decryption algorithm using the Lorenz Attractor, a chaotic system, to provide a robust encryption mechanism. The method leverages the unpredictability of chaotic systems for secure image processing.

## Papers that inspired the project:
- [A novel image encryption scheme using Lorenz attractor](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5138890)
- [A New Image Encryption Algorithm Based on Lorenz System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7861097)

## Installs:
```
numpy
